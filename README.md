Repository for my individual project on Automation and Control MSc

##Disclaimer
In the arduino and raspberry pi folders a considerable amount of the code is not original. 
Most of the tests are internet examples with some modifications, or mashup of multiple examples.
Anyway the "module" files are mmostly written completly by me although probalbly heavily inspired by the tests files.
